# Facial Nerve Paralysis Assessment and Analysis

Hi! This is a repository for my project on Facial Nerve Paralysis Assessment and Analysis. 

I attempted to create a system that can automatically grade the severity of facial nerve paralysis, but I wasn't able to achieve the desired accuracy. Other parts of my research involves testing and evaluating the performance of Emotrics, while applied on published datasets (see References below).
My project also heavily relies on Emotrics, which is a machine-learning-based facial landmark predictor that allows us to extract facial keypoint from images.
More information about the project can be found in the [project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ozB-bke3uC8R5cgGGeYMG5l7_y9zn0PbHrpjxoZ-Jcc/edit?usp=sharing). 

To recreate the environment I used for this project, get [bp.yml](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VxIDr4r6lI-sq2YFE5xBlVtrZPceQCNS/view?usp=share_link) and run the following command:

    conda env create -f bp.yml
